## Challenges faced

In developing Standom, we considered GameFi, SocialFi, and a posting platform, and even designed tokenomics.
However, the price of utility and governance tokens will be reduced because creators will exchange tokens for JPY.
In other words, deflation will continue.
We faced this problem, but by making it the community of NFTs, only the fans who contributed to the community were rewarded, while at the same time allowing the creators to raise their income significantly.
We were also able to reduce the deflation problem considerably by using ETH on polygon instead of tokenomics.
