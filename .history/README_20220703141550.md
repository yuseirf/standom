# standom for Polygon Hacker House

## Project Name

Standom

## About Project(2-3 lines)

Standom is IP content-driven community of fans and creators, which will create more enthusiasm globally for IP content (such as manga and anime) with Web3.

## the problem it is solving

Fan activities are basically free. We think rewards should be returned to them.
Then, some of this is done illegally, such as derivative works and pirated edition.
In fact, damage caused by pirated edition is estimated at 9.6 billion dollars($1 = 136 JPY).
In addition, the growth of fan economy  is not over yet especially overseas.
When it comes to manga, if enthusiasm of overseas manga fans is as much as we have in Japan, overseas fan economy would be 81 billion dollars, about 10 times the current market size.

## Challenges faced

In developing Standom, we considered GameFi, SocialFi, and a posting platform, and even designed tokenomics.
However, the price of utility and governance tokens will be reduced because creators will exchange tokens for JPY.
In other words, deflation will continue.
We faced this problem, but by making it the community of NFTs, only the fans who contributed to the community were rewarded, while at the same time allowing the creators to raise their income significantly.
We were also able to reduce the deflation problem considerably by using ETH on polygon instead of tokenomics.
